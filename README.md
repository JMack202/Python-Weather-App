# Python-Weather-App
Developed a desktop weather application that allows users to check the current weather by entering a city name. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays temperature, description, and an emoji representing the weather condition.
Implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt5, featuring input fields, buttons, and labels to display weather data.
Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data based on user input.
Error handling: Included robust error handling to manage issues such as incorrect city names, connectivity problems, or API errors.
Dynamic UI updates: Displayed weather information including temperature, description, and weather icons based on conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).
Customized design: Used CSS styling within PyQt5 to improve user interface appearance and enhance user experience.
